# Assumptions of Logistic Regression, Clearly Explained
### Definitive guide (with Python codes) to understanding and implementing the assumption checks behind one of the most important statistical techniques in dataÂ science - Logistic Regression

- Logistic regression is a highly effective mainstay statistical technique still frequently used today, despite being developed since the 1940s.
- Given its popularity and utility, data practitioners must understand the key fundamentals of logistic regression while using it to tackle data and business problems.
- In this project, we explore the assumptions of logistic regression by explaining the theoretical concepts and practical implementation of the assumption checks in Python.
